# Dynamic Shipping Rate Optimization

This project provides an API and web interface to dynamically predict shipping rates based on package weight, distance, and chosen shipping method. The system leverages machine learning techniques to optimize shipping costs, providing businesses with an efficient way to calculate and manage shipping expenses.

## ðŸ”§ Setup Instructions

To get started with the **Dynamic Shipping Rate Optimization** project, follow the instructions below.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the installation by running the following command:
```bash
python --version

### 2. Train the Model
The project uses a machine learning model to predict shipping rates. To train the model, make sure to have the required dataset available. You can use a dataset with historical shipping data (package weight, distance, shipping cost). Follow these steps to train the model:

Preprocess the data, including cleaning and feature engineering.
Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to create a model for shipping rate prediction.
Save the trained model for use in the Flask backend
