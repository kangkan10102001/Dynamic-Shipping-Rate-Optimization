# Dynamic Shipping Rate Optimization

This project provides an API and web interface to dynamically predict shipping rates based on package weight, distance, and chosen shipping method. The system leverages machine learning techniques to optimize shipping costs, providing businesses with an efficient way to calculate and manage shipping expenses.

## üîß Setup Instructions

To get started with the **Dynamic Shipping Rate Optimization** project, follow the instructions below.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the installation by running the following command:
```bash
python --version
If Python is installed, create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment:

On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install Flask, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and other necessary libraries for the project.

2. Train the Model
The project uses a machine learning model to predict shipping rates. To train the model, make sure to have the required dataset available. You can use a dataset with historical shipping data (package weight, distance, shipping cost). Follow these steps to train the model:

Preprocess the data, including cleaning and feature engineering.
Use Scikit-learn or TensorFlow to create a model for shipping rate prediction.
Save the trained model for use in the Flask backend.
Example:

import pickle
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load the training data
# X contains features like weight and distance, Y contains shipping costs
X, Y = load_data()

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, Y)

# Save the model
with open('shipping_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)
3. Set Up the Database
For this project, a database is used to store records of the shipments and their calculated shipping rates. Follow these steps to set up the database:

Install PostgreSQL or MySQL on your system.
Create a database and configure it in the Flask app.
Run the Flask app to create tables automatically if required.
Example (for PostgreSQL):

psql -U postgres
CREATE DATABASE shipping_rates;
Ensure the database connection is properly configured in config.py or in the Flask app settings.

4. Run Flask API
To start the Flask API, run the following command:

python app.py
The Flask application will start, and you can access the API at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

To test the API, you can send a POST request to /shipping_rate with a JSON payload containing weight, distance, and shipping_method values.

5. Open the Web Interface
The project includes a simple HTML interface that allows users to input package information and see the predicted shipping rate.

Open the index.html file in a browser.
Enter the package details like weight, distance, and shipping method.
Click "Calculate" to get the shipping rate.
üìå Features

Shipping Rate Prediction: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict shipping rates based on package weight and distance.
