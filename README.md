# Dynamic Shipping Rate Calculator

## Overview
The **Dynamic Shipping Rate Calculator** is a web-based application that calculates real-time shipping rates based on various factors such as package weight, dimensions, delivery destination, and shipping method. The project uses **Flask** for the backend, AI for intelligent predictions, and integrates multiple shipping carrier APIs (such as FedEx, UPS, and DHL) to provide accurate shipping rates to users.

The system leverages machine learning models to predict the best shipping rates and options dynamically. This application aims to automate the shipping rate calculation process, saving time for businesses and customers while ensuring cost-effective and reliable delivery methods.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Shipping Rates**: The system integrates with shipping carrier APIs like FedEx, UPS, and DHL to calculate live shipping costs based on user-provided package details.
- **AI-Powered Predictions**: The backend uses machine learning algorithms to predict optimal shipping rates, delivery time, and method based on historical data and real-time inputs.
- **Carrier Comparison**: Users can compare shipping rates from different carriers, allowing them to select the most cost-effective or fastest shipping option.
- **Intelligent Rate Optimization**: The AI model learns from previous shipments and continuously improves the predictions for future calculations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The system offers an easy-to-use web interface where users can enter their package details and instantly see the available shipping options with rates and estimated delivery times.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: Used for creating the front-end interface of the application.
- **React**: A JavaScript library used to build the user interface in a dynamic, component-based manner, allowing smooth updates without reloading the page.
- **Flask**: The Python-based web framework is used for handling the backend logic and processing API requests.
- **Python (Machine Learning)**: Python is used to build and run machine learning models that optimize and predict shipping rates based on historical and real-time data.
- **Shipping Carrier APIs**: Integration with FedEx, UPS, DHL, and other carriers to fetch real-time shipping data.
- **MySQL**: Used for storing user data, shipment history, and predictions.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Used for developing the AI model that predicts the most accurate shipping rates.

## Setup Instructions
### Frontend Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-shipping-rate.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd dynamic-shipping-rate
Install frontend dependencies:
npm install
Start the front-end server:
npm start
Backend Setup (Flask)
Install backend dependencies using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API keys for the shipping carriers in the .env file.
Start the Flask server:
python app.py
Running the Application
The front-end will run on http://localhost:3000.
The Flask backend will run on http://localhost:5000.
How It Works

User Input: Users input their package details (weight, dimensions, destination) through the front-end interface.
API Requests: The backend (Flask) sends these details to the appropriate shipping carrier APIs to get live rates.
AI Model: The AI model predicts the optimal shipping method and rate based on the input and historical data.
Carrier Comparison: The system compares rates from various carriers and displays them to the user.
User Selection: The user selects the desired shipping option, and the system provides an estimated delivery time and cost.
Future Enhancements

Integration of more shipping carriers.
Adding a user account system to save shipment details and preferences.
Enhanced AI models for better rate prediction and optimization.
Real-time tracking integration.
