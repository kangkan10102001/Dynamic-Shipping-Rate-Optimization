# Dynamic Shipping Rate Optimization

## Overview
This project provides an API and web interface to dynamically predict shipping rates based on package weight, distance, and shipping method. The system leverages machine learning techniques to optimize shipping costs, providing businesses with an efficient way to calculate and manage shipping expenses.

## Features
- **Shipping Rate Prediction**: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict shipping rates based on package weight and distance.
- **Shipping Method**: Allows users to select between standard or express shipping methods.
- **Web Interface**: Simple, user-friendly web interface for input and displaying results.
- **Flask Backend**: The Flask API handles user requests, runs the prediction model, and returns the shipping cost.
- **Database Integration**: Stores shipment records and predictions in a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
- **Error Handling**: The system provides appropriate error messages if input data is missing or incorrect.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Flask** (for creating the API)
- **Scikit-learn** (for machine learning model)
- **TensorFlow** (for deep learning model, optional)
- **PostgreSQL/MySQL** (for relational database)
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript** (for frontend web interface)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.8+). Then, install the necessary dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Running the Project
### Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/dynamic-shipping-rate-optimization.git
cd dynamic-shipping-rate-optimization

### Train the model (using historical shipping data):
# Example to train a simple model
import pickle
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load and preprocess data
X, Y = load_data()

# Train the model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X, Y)

# Save the model
with open('shipping_model.pkl', 'wb') as file:
    pickle.dump(model, file)

Set up the database:
Install PostgreSQL or MySQL.
Create a database (shipping_rates).
Configure database connection in config.py or Flask settings.

Run the Flask API:
python app.py
The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.
Open the Web Interface:
Open index.html in a browser.
Enter the package details (weight, distance, shipping method).
Click "Calculate" to get the shipping rate.
Dataset

This project uses historical shipping data, including package weight, distance, and shipping cost. This data can be used to train the machine learning model for accurate predictions.

Model Training

The machine learning model is trained using Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The steps for training the model include:

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data and engineer the features (e.g., weight, distance).
Model Training: A regression model (e.g., Linear Regression) is trained to predict the shipping rates.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on a validation dataset and fine-tune the model.
Future Enhancements

Support for Additional Shipping Methods: Include more shipping methods like same-day delivery or international shipping.
Real-Time API: Implement an API for real-time shipping rate updates based on external factors.
Mobile Application: Develop a mobile app for ease of use on the go.
